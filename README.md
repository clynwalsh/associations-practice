# App Academy A03 Associations Practice Assessment #

This assessment is book-themed, because I like books.

1. Open the LibraryAssocPractice directory and follow the instructions in the README.
2. Sail to success on your actual assessment.

Heads-up: this practice is significantly more complicated than the official practice.  Don't freak out!  You can do it!
Reach out @clynwalsh on slack if you find any issues.
